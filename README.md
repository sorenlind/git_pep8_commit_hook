git\_pep8\_commit\_hook
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sorenlind/git_pep8_commit_hook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sorenlind/git_pep8_commit_hook)

Git pre-commit hook for checking coding style of Python code. The hook requires pep8. It will check files with the `.py` extension and files that contain `#!` (shebang) and `python` in the first line. Heavily inspired by and partly based on [git-pylint-commit-hook](https://github.com/sebdah/git-pylint-commit-hook) by Sebastian Dahlgren.

Since `pep8` itself, by default, looks for a `setup.cfg` file in the repository root directory, so does this script. The script works without the `setup.cfg` file. The options for the script can either be placed in the `[pep8_pre_commit_hook]` section of the configuration file or be passed as command line parameters. If the same option is specified in both the configuration file and the parameters, the configuration file takes precedence.


Installation
------------

Install via PyPI

```
git install git_pep8_commit_hook
```


Usage
------

Having installed the script, if you add it to your `pre-commit` file which should be placed in the `hooks` subfolder for the Git folder (usually `.git/hooks`), it will be called automatically when you run `git commit`. If you want to skip the checks for a certain commit, you can add the `-n` flag and run `git commit -n`.

### Configuration

By default, the script looks for a `setup.cfg` in the root directory of your repository. If the script does not find a configuration file, it uses default settings. The file might look like this:

```
[pep8]
ignore = E226,E302,E41
max-line-length = 79

[pep8_pre_commit_hook]
max-violations-per-file = 5
```

The `[pep8]` section is used by pep8. The `[pep8_pre_commit_hook]` section is used by the commit hook script. You may specify the following options:

* **command** is for the actual command, for instance if pep8 is not installed globally, but is in a virtualenv inside the project itself.

* **params** lets you pass custom parameters to pep8

* **max-violations-per-file** lets you specify how many violations of the PEP 0008 standard you are willing to accept for any file. If at least one file has more than the specified number of violations, the commit will be blocked. The default value is 0.

Any of these can be bypassed directly in the pre-commit hook itself.  You can also set a different default place to look for the pylintrc file.

Running tests
-------------

The tests are written using `pytest`. You can run the tests without installing pytest and without installing the script by typing `python runtests.py`. Alternatively, you can install pytest by running `pip install pytest`. The script itself can be installed in development mode by running `pip install -e .` from the root directory of the repository. Then the tests can be run by executing `py.test`.

Requirements
------------

This commit hook is written in Python and has the following requirements:

- [pep8](https://github.com/pycqa/pep8) (`sudo pip install pep8`)
